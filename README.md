This app is designed to assess the sustainability of industrial infrastructure by evaluating two critical factors: energy usage and carbon emissions. The underlying logic of the app revolves around a simple yet effective comparison of input values against established sustainability thresholds. Energy usage is measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh), and carbon output is calculated in kilograms of CO₂. When a user inputs data, such as the energy consumed or the carbon emissions produced by a particular infrastructure, the app checks whether these values exceed predefined limits, which are set based on global sustainability guidelines. If either the energy usage surpasses 500 kWh or the carbon output exceeds 300 kg of CO₂, the app flags the result as potentially harmful and issues a suggestion to consider renewable energy sources, optimize operations, or adopt sustainable materials to lower the environmental impact. Conversely, if the values remain within the limits, the app reassures users that their energy and carbon levels are within a sustainable range, promoting continuous monitoring for long-term sustainability. This approach allows the app to function not only as a tool for tracking energy usage but also as an educational resource, raising awareness about the importance of minimizing environmental footprints and making better, greener choices in industrial operations.
